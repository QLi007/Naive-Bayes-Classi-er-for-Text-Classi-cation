1 Data Set
The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, par-
titioned (nearly) evenly across 20 dierent newsgroups. It was originally collected by Ken Lang,
probably for his Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews [1] paper, though he did not ex-
plicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for
experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classication and text
clustering.
The data is organized into 20 dierent newsgroups, each corresponding to a dierent topic. Here
is a list of the 20 newsgroups:
alt.atheism
